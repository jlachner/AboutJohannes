## Hi there! ‚úåüèΩ

My name is Johannes and I'm a Postdoc at [MIT](https://newmanlab.mit.edu/). My research interests include motor neuroscience and robot control to help people with neurological and physical disorders. Before, I was an employee of [KUKA Corporate Research](https://www.kuka.com/en-de/future-production/research-and-development), where I specialized in robot control with focus on physical interaction. 

I'm fascinated by the beauty of Geometry! In case you are interested, check out some of my code here :)
