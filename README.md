## Hi there! ‚úåüèΩ

My name is Johannes and I'm a Postdoc at MIT. My research interests include motor neuroscience and robot control to help people with neurological and physical disorders. 

You might also want to check out our open-source software [Exp[licit]](https://explicit-robotics.github.io/), which can be used to model, simulate, and control a variety of robots. The algorithms behind the software are based on the Differential Geometric concept, called Product of Exponentials Formula.
