## Hi there! ‚úåüèΩ

My name is Johannes and I'm a Postdoc at [MIT](https://newmanlab.mit.edu/). My research interests include motor neuroscience and robot control to help people with neurological and physical disorders. Before, I was an employee of KUKA Corporate Research, where I specialized in robot control with focus on physical interaction. 

I'm fascinated by the beauty of Geometry! In case you are interested, check out my [Website](https://jlachner.github.io/) or my code here :)
